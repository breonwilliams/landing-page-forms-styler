## Description

Landing Page Forms Styler lets you create and manage multiple form‐style presets via a clean admin UI. Define a **Title** and **Custom Class**, then tweak field and button borders, colors, radii, typography, spacing, and more—all with an optional live preview. Assign your class in Elementor (or any theme) and your forms adopt your styles automatically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I apply different presets on the same page?**  
A: Yes—just assign distinct custom classes to different form widgets.

**Q: Does this work with non-Elementor forms?**  
A: Absolutely. Any form container using your custom class will inherit the styles.

**Q: Where do I find my custom class field in Elementor?**  
A: Under **Advanced → CSS Classes** in the form widget’s settings.
